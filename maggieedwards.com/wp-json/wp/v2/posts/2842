Is it really that serious?\r\n\r\n<strong>I\u2019m 100% certain that if we pull together\u00a0an international positive attitude, do the right thing, stay calm, hopeful, healthy, strong and look after vulnerable<\/strong><strong>\u00a0ones, we\u2019ll make it through! Everything starts with your Mindset. Make sure you look after your mindset every day.<\/strong>\r\n\r\nI believe that within each crisis lies an opportunity for us to reflect, get stronger and better. So, for you, there is right now opportunity\u00a0to grow stronger, wiser, and more resilient. Put a smile on your face, focus on the good, take a break, do and think positive things, use this time in the best possible way, look after your health, eat whole and natural ingredients, stay active (home or outside)\u00a0and look after your family and friends.\r\n\r\nThis is only a temporary situation. Try to be proactive and not reactive. Plan your day better,\u00a0improve your daily routines, adapt to the new rules and regulations but don&#8217;t ignore your mindest. Reinvent your self-care, Get creative and increase the intensity of the things which put you in a\u00a0good mood.\u00a0Do not forget to strengthen your immune system, because this is the only way\u00a0how we will conquer the\u00a0virus.\r\n\r\n<strong>Take really good care of yourself!!!<\/strong>\r\n\r\nMinimise TV and detach yourself from negativity. Neuroscience has proven, that we become what we think all day long. What are you thinking about today? What did you think about yesterday? \u00a0What are you planning to do tomorrow and after tomorrow? We, humans, are super intelligent, but most of us don&#8217;t know how to use this superpower to our advantage. <strong>Why?<\/strong> Because no one thought us how to use it.\r\n\r\nThis is an area of growth, development ane big shifts. Make sure you are doing your bit and you are changing as the world around us is changing. I am offering bespoke coaching programs for those who need scientific explanations as to why we don&#8217;t progress or repeat the same mistakes over and over again. If you need proof, I show you. If you need to be convinced that the neuro research is right, I can show you that. For now, focus on your results. See if you can achieve your personal and professional goals on your own? If not, then there is something which is stopping you. Do you know what that is? If not, maybe it&#8217;s time to ask for help&#8230;.?\r\n\r\n<strong>Life is short, use it well.<\/strong>\r\n\r\nxo\r\n\r\nMaggie","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>First, wherever you are right now, I hope you, your family, and loved ones are safe and well?
