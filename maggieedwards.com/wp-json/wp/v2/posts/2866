Can I ask for more love, happiness, peace, understanding, support and success? Is it even possible? Do I have the right to ask for more?\u201d\r\n\r\nWhen I was growing up back in Poland, people were following socially accepted trends and patterns. First was to get a boyfriend, then driving license, start university, straight after getting engaged, wedding + kids and maybe for some of them a divorce.\r\n\r\nWhen I was 17 years old I always had older friends and I was enjoying my time with them because they were always so super interesting. They were actually talking sense and it was my favourite entertainment.\r\n\r\nI actually did not have much to talk about with friends who were my age especially in college, it just felt that I did not fit in.\r\n\r\nI thought for a very long time I was \u201cdifferent\u201d (in a bad way), it is strange why I could not just be like them, my mum was saying all the time \u201cWhy can\u2019t you be normal like everyone else\u201c(whatever that meant?!?) but despite all that, the one important decision I made, and probably one of the best decisions you can make in life, is to accept yourself for who you are and just be YOURSELF!\r\n\r\nWhen I was 20 years old I chose to leave Poland and went to Vienna in Austria, where I learnt German, which was for me a total disaster in its own right \ud83d\ude29. German did not suit me and I did not suit the German language. I was hustling from one job to another trying to cover my university financial costs and live the basics of life. It was tough, but I did everything I could &#8211; I was a babysitter, ironing lady and a window cleaner. I did everything you could imagine.\r\n\r\nEventually, I became a waitress working in various restaurants in Vienna. Whilst working at the restaurant I was listening to \u201colder\u201c people and their life stories and experience &#8211; it was so great! It was for me the best thing ever because I was gathering information about life from people who knew more than I did at that point in time. From my own experiences and knowledge I gained, I made up my mind what I wanted from LIFE!\r\n\r\nStaying truly honest to who I was, I made a \u201cDecision\u201d that I will have a successful life, a beautiful family, I will build a house, have my own company and be happy and fulfilled, appreciating each day.\r\n\r\n<strong>It was a choice and this was my decision!<\/strong>\r\n\r\nAnd this is why I do not follow socially accepted trends or patterns. I believe in the freedom of choice and as long as you want to pursue your happiness you are on the right path!\r\n\r\nSince moving to the UK, I am fully committed to my personal journey and extremely privileged to help others.\r\n\r\n<strong>If you do not question things, you will never find out.<\/strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>If you do not raise your standards you will never achieve more. <\/strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>\u00a0If you do not seek you never find.<\/strong>\r\n\r\nI prefer to be this way because this gives me ultimate happiness.\r\n\r\nI truly believe that there is nothing wrong with wanting more.\r\n\r\n<strong>What do you want from life and from yourself?<\/strong>\r\n\r\nWe are so resourceful and capable of so much more; we are here for a reason! I encourage you to keep striving for more, as this is where true happiness lies \ud83e\udd29 .\r\n\r\nAny thoughts?","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Have you ever been in a situation where you have asked yourself: \u201cCan I ask for more?
