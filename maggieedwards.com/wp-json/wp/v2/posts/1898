I don\u2019t have to do it, I thought&#8230;The truth was that it was very important for me to answer this question, especially at that point. \u00a0It was even more important to answer since I did not have the answer.\r\nMoving one, the question was asked, not once but at least 10 times during the coaching program, and I did not know the answer to it. \u00a0It is important to mention that back then I was at the pick at my corporate career, burnt out, not finding any time for myself, nor my fianc\u00e9 and being so much in a rush that I completely forgot \u2018\u2019how to relax\u2019\u2019. \u00a0My life was very busy and very stressful.\r\n\r\nFast-forward a year, I finally found the answer to that question, because the truth is \u2018\u2019I just had to\u201d. I was feeling disconnected from myself, my inner voice, and felt for a long time that something was just off. It is difficult to describe, but I think that anyone whoever was in a \u00a0slightly similar situation is able to relate.\r\n\r\nThe answer was rather simple. I lost touch with my true self by being in a very competitive environment, doing business deals, focusing only at material things, and I lost connection with a part of me who was responsible for being present, connected, not being able to appreciate meaningful relationships.\r\n\r\nSince then I&#8217;ve changed my career I am now a coach and a therapist on a weekly basis I am working with my clients who search the answer to the same question. My experience is as follows:\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>&#8221; We attract what we Focus On&#8221;<\/strong><\/p>\r\nIf we fully only focus on the business and deals, eventually we won&#8217;t have time and space to enjoy other things in life. Based on the neuroscience, the neurons, which fire together, wire together. The connections in our brain get stronger when we simply think about something it includes our emotions (how we feel when we think about it ) and noises ( if applicable), any specific pictures, memories. The repetition of those thoughts and ideas strengthen the connections in our brains each time we think about it. \u00a0The more you do it, the more powerful it becomes. There is also one major mind rule&#8221; our mind can not hold conflicting believes&#8221; therefore if you are at work and work hard and focus the entire day about the holiday, \u00a0only one thing will work. You will either work or you will pretend that you worked and in fact, you will think about the holiday. \u00a0The point which I try to make is: be aware of what you focus one. If you focus on the wrong, unsatisfying, unfulfilling activities, you will get nowhere near to the right answers. If you, however, search the answer to the right questions, you will find them. \u00a0Ask yourself these questions:\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>What am I looking for in life? <\/strong>\r\n<strong>What am I missing in my life today? <\/strong>\r\n<strong>How I want my life to be two years from now?<\/strong><\/p>\r\nThis simple questions will redirect your focus to find the answer to the question: Who are you? Why does it matter? Why do you need to do it? It matters because in order to be fully successful you need to find the balance between work, family, free time and hobby. Life is much more than the bank account balance, diplomas and luxurious holiday. It is much more than showing off and feeding out Ego. Life is a mixture of different areas, which we should learn to balance because only then you will be able to feel the true success and live to your fullest potential. Everything starts with the decision and\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Everything starts with You!\r\n<\/strong>\r\nIf you like this article share it with your friends.<\/p>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>A few years ago, my first ever life coach asked me this question: \u201cWho are You when you strip out your work, certifications, family, relationships and all material things?\u201d The irony was, that at that point in my life I was convinced I had all the answers, and instantly I had a million thoughts, within few seconds I&#8217;ve questioned why I even engaged with that coach, I said I don\u2019t need a coach, this is total nonsense answering such crazy questions.
