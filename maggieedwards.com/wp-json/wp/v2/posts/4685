This is the biggest, most powerful force driving your thoughts, behaviours, results in your life. You may say: Maggie, are you serious, this is ridiculous!\r\n\r\nUnfortunately for sceptics, it is bad news, sorry sceptics! I know how much you dislike this subject and question every single statement. I have heard for the last 20 years, a million times sceptics were telling me \u201c it can\u2019t be done\u201d of course it was correct for them! It was not possible for them, they never achieved it, never progressed further.\u00a0I have achieved my success based on my positive beliefs, values and drive, which sceptics were very often\u00a0 \u201cstilling away from me\u201d, never feeding.\u00a0But, as a reminder, this blog is not for sceptics, because this content is focused on the opportunities, possibilities, success and tapping to your unlimited supply and not limitations.\r\n\r\nAs Dr Joseph Murphy said: <em>\u201cWhatever thought, beliefs, values, opinions, theories, attitudes, you impress on your subconscious mind, you will experience them as the objective manifestation\u00a0of circumstances, conditions and events. What you write on the inside, you will experience on the outside<\/em>.\u201d As one of the greatest American philosophers, Ralph Waldo Emerson said:<strong> \u201c Man is what he thinks all day long \u201d<\/strong>. He is correct, and modern neuroscience research, studies, tests and epigenetic confirm the same.\r\n\r\nToday I present to you few most important Mind Rules. I hope you read them, understand them and check with yourself if this is correct for you. The benefit you gain from reading this article is reflecting on each mind rule, coming up with ideas from your past experience and checking how does it show up for you.\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li><strong>Mind Rule 1: \u201cYour mind loves what\u2019s familiar.\u201d <\/strong><\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\nIf thinking negative, being judgmental towards yourself is something familiar, you will be doing it for the rest of your life, until you decide to change that habit and turn it into a positive one. If you always eat ice cream, pizza, take away when you feel upset, sad and miserable, that will always happen as this is a familiar pattern to you. Your mind does not decide if this is good or bad for you, it will always do what&#8217;s familiar. The strongest habit always wins.\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li><strong>Mind Rule 2: \u201cIf you believe in it, it will become true\u201d. <\/strong><\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\nIf you believe that you work hard, and no one appreciates your work, trust me it will manifest exactly this way. Other people will be promoted, will get higher bonus and you will be left in the corner with the minimum bonus and might never be promoted. Your inner belief is your compass which \u201cmoves you subconsciously\u201d in the direction in line with your belief. In turn, If you believe in miracles, you will experience them at some point in your life.\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li><strong>Mind rule 3: \u201cThe Mind responds only to the words you say and pictures, images you create in your mind\u201d.\u00a0<\/strong><\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\nIf you say to yourself every day: \u201cI can do it. Today is going to be a great day\u201d You will have a good day, improved performance, focus and will get a lot done. If you say to yourself\u201d I hate my life, I am a loser\u201d and repeat that very often, then your mind will ensure that you find evidence every day that this statement is correct, will limit your intelligence and will stop you from progressing in your career and life. Anxiety, depression all these conditions are starting in our minds, it is not a coincidence and it is not a fate. This whole process is driven by the power of your mind.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Mind rules are simply the \u201clanguage of your subconscious mind\u201d.
