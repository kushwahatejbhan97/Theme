Why? Because the more you are\u00a0thinking you are preparing\u00a0yourself for it, in truth, you are only coming up with many things of &#8221; what if \/what can go wrong&#8221; which 95\u00a0% of things which are ever\u00a0likely to happen.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">In most cases, we are\u00a0focusing on the negatives and apply default thinking.\r\n&#8220;what can go wrong&#8221; rather than\r\n<strong>&#8221; what can go right?&#8221;<\/strong> or<strong> &#8221; what will I gain?&#8221;\u00a0<\/strong><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">Negative thinking is at the present moment a default thinking because\u00a0as we grow and develop our lives, social trends are teaching us, reminding us all the time that life is a scary place, it is dangerous, that we can&#8217;t do\u00a0everything. We should be aware of the possibility to get hurt. Keeping\u00a0the things the same, makes us feel safe and secure, in control, it feels like we know what we are doing,\u00a0but is it really this way? Is your life this way?<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">There is so much I could write about it, but this will come in the next message.\u00a0I have noticed in the last 6 years that\u00a0&#8220;old definition of what&#8217;s safe&#8221; is being shifted\u00a0by millennials, social trends which are indirectly changing how we live our lives, influencing the market trends, how we do business, and\u00a0operate. One thing which no one\u00a0can&#8217;t stop is to change. The constant flow of energy, services and inventions, it is not something which we can control.\r\nThey say if you can&#8217;t beat them join them&#8230;<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">Coming back to the point of making the\u00a0first step I would like to remind you that,\u00a0everyone who have done things for the first time never done it well. Just think about it for a few minutes.\r\nDo you remember the\u00a0time in your life when you have done something for the first time? How well have you done it? How well have you performed?\u00a0There is no one on this planet who I know, who succeeds straight away. There is no such thing like &#8220;overnight success&#8221;.\u00a0Everything in life requires time, trails, first steps and many after.\r\nElon Musk said: &#8221; When you struggle with a problem that is when you understand it&#8221; Right?\r\nSo I challenge you today to answer this question for yourself:<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">\r\n<strong>What is your true attitude?<\/strong>\r\n<strong>Are you reluctant to take the first step?<\/strong>\r\n<strong>Is fear from unknown\u00a0controlling your present?\u00a0<\/strong><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">You see, life is full of surprises and opportunities. If we do nothing, nothing will change. If you notice opportunities in your life, only then you will be able to use them, but that&#8217;s step number two. First, you need to notice them.\u00a0You need also\u00a0appreciate and feel that you are always in control, even if sometimes you may FEEL like it that you are not.\u00a0It is your choice, what will you do, and how will you do it.\u00a0You\u00a0get to decide in a motion (autopilot mode) or with full awareness,\u00a0curiosity and an open mind\u00a0(higher mind).<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>&#8220;what are you going to do next?&#8221;<\/strong><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">If you refocus your mind and start thinking about:\r\n&#8221;\u00a0what will I\u00a0gain? What will I learn?&#8221; \u00a0all of a sudden, your awareness will expand just a little\u00a0and all things which were not possible yesterday become possible today.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">If you need a helping hand in making the first choice towards Your Change, get in touch!<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-size: large;\">If you would like to send me a personal\u00a0message, please contact me here:\u00a0\u00a0<a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">info@maggieedwards.com<\/a><\/span><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-size: large;\">Follow me on <a href=\"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/maggieedwards.coach\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Instagram<\/a> \u2665\r\nto be up to date with a\u00a0daily dose of motivation and inspiration.<\/span><\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Only the first step is the hardest.
