In short, current coaching methods are transformative and you will only understand\u00a0it, once you try it!\u00a0It&#8217;s like having the most amazing\u00a0beautiful relationship with another person, which you&#8217;ll\u00a0remember forever, or maybe that first magical kiss!\u00a0\u00a0Those special moments you always remember because these moments were transformative to\u00a0you. (Backed up by neuroscience).\r\nSo, for me being in the corporate world for such a long time and using my logical brain ALL the time\u00a0working\u00a0at a high pace and within an exceptionally\u00a0competitive\u00a0<wbr \/>environment\u00a0made me feel like some kind of machine, and in 2017 I\u00a0hit rock bottom in my life. So little did I know&#8230;&#8230;..\u00a0It is a clique, but it is true. As they say, &#8220;only the truth can save you&#8221;, so this is my truth&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;.\r\nBack then everything from the outside looked sooooo &#8221;perfect&#8221;,\u00a0amazing job, great performance, big plans for the future, exclusive holidays, brand new house, selection of diplomas on the wall, yet there was a\u00a0big gap. The gap was a disconnection from my true self and from my purpose. I always strived for more, and I always would set myself big goals, which made me happy,\u00a0but at that\u00a0point, it was different, because\u00a0having all that\u00a0I still felt lost.\r\n\r\nI thought I could logically explain and had answers for everything, but inside emotionally I was just one\u00a0big mess.\u00a0There was no choice than to\u00a0commit\u00a0to the coaching session and have trust\u00a0in the process because. To my &#8221;amazement&#8221; it started working.\u00a0During and after each coaching session I started to feel like ME again &#8211; happy, funny, loving, caring,\u00a0interested in life and people, planning for the future and honestly moving forward in my life. I started again to be excited\u00a0about my prospects!\r\n\r\nFast forward to today to my personal transformation\u00a0in\u00a02018, \u00a0I quit my well-paid job, and I opened my two companies which was my dream come true. I&#8217;ve started my accredited coaching education because I fell in love with this job. Today I am helping others to live to their fullest potential, getting unstuck and what they want.\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Life is too short to waste it and play it small.\u00a0<\/strong><\/p>\r\nIf you feel like you are going in circles and you are not reaching your\u00a0personal goals or maybe stuck in a rut, and never had coaching before, I invite you to your free\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.maggieedwards.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" data-saferedirecturl=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/url?q=http:\/\/www.maggieedwards.com\/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1588087744524000&amp;usg=AFQjCNEjyqIpymfFhLdfzGJP-iQ4vqShSA\">confidential consultation<\/a>, where you can sit back, relax and understand what is holding you back.\r\n\r\nIf you would like to stay connected please follow me on social media and get in touch if you feel like you need support.\r\n\r\n<strong>Stay Strong,\u00a0healthy &amp; Love Your Life&#8230;.. you only have one!\u00a0<\/strong>\r\nxo\r\n\r\n&nbsp;","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Overload of information is usually creating confusion, disconnection, lack of focus and unnecessary\u00a0stress.
