It is a lot. In fact, we do it even without realizing it, because we operate on \u201cautopilot.\u201d Most of this process is driven by our subconscious mind, which we are unable to control all of the time, however, we can influence it.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">So what is happening? Is it that we are simply planning the next move, our \u201cfuture,\u201d the next meeting, task, a break, or even the next meal? We also spend a lot of time \u201cthinking about what happened in the past\u201d a few minutes ago, a month ago or 10 years ago. We also remind ourselves why the past, and what happened, how we felt, what emotions we had, what has been said, and why it matters to us right now.\u00a0In between, there are a lot of uncontrolled thoughts that come and go, which are running through our neuropathways, which sometimes stop us from doing what we really supposed to do in our day to day lives.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">So to stop some of our \u201cuncontrolled thinking patterns\u201d which are not good for us, we have to pause or stop even if it is for only a few minutes.\u00a0By being in the present moment you focus fully on what is happening right now, today, in this very second in your life.\u00a0You don\u2019t drift away, you don\u2019t daydream, and you don\u2019t waste your time. You are not negotiating in your mind whether you should or should not do something. You simply stop, to focus fully on what you supposed to do next. I know it sounds simple but it is not!<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">For example, now you are reading this post, and you try to gain some knowledge and fuller understating on this subject. After that, you may scroll on the blog and find the different articles, after that you may set up a free consultation with me to see how we can work together, or maybe you may critique this blog and simply move on to a different life coach webpage.\u00a0Whatever that is for you, you have a free will and a choice. This free choice we use a lot during the day, but the choice is driven by your habitual, learned behaviors. It is driven by your subconscious mind and a level of awareness.\u00a0In short, the choice is for you to learn more how you can improve your life by working with me, making necessary decisions in your life, moving things forward, completing unfinished jobs or things which have been uncompleted for ages, or to stay where you are and procrastinating more into the future, waiting for the perfect moment, which never comes.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\">The longer you leave it, the worse it will get!<\/h2>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">This is what most of the population does it because it is the easy way out. It is a shame because they are missing out so much. Based on research, most people cannot focus enough on the task which they are performing or on important stuff which they should be doing in their life, because they have a habit of living too much in the past or future and not being present. It can only be a loss for one person\u2026 YOU!<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">By practicing being in the present moment you are only gaining freedom and focus, but also the power of your choice and wisdom. You are practicing your focus and awareness of what is happening in your life right now. You take a wider look at reality and create better choices. You are able to change unwanted behaviors and turn them into the new successful habits, which will actually serve you in your life. You will and can finally see what really is not helping you, and change it to something good and positive. You can, in a controlled way analyze your behavioral patterns, and decide if this is how you can and want to carry on with your life.<\/p>\r\nMy coaching programs are designed to teach my clients how they can do it successfully and anytime they need to, so if you are interested in knowing more, get in touch!\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">HERE&#8230; <strong>Remember to practice being in the present moment<\/strong><\/p>\r\n&nbsp;","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>I am sure you have heard many times before \u201cbe in the present moment.\u201d In fact, this statement is absolutely correct.
