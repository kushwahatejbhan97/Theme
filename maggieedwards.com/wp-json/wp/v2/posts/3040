It is simply habitual, individually created structure of thinking, which you build over the years, repeated multiple times in your life that becomes part of your life. The role of self-sabotage is to \u201c<strong>keep you in your comfort zone\u2019\u2019<\/strong>, missing out on all exciting things in your life, stopping you from learning new things, and quietly convincing yourself that the new thing which in fact is good for you is \u201cbad for you\u201d.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">Every time you buy into it, you stay where you are and slowly move backward.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">So when you don\u2019t progress in life, you take a step backward. My mentor Richard Bandler said: \u201cThe truth is Maggie you never stay the same, you either get better or you get worse\u201d. Think about it for a minute. If for example someone has social anxiety and does nothing about it, with time the anxiety grows, this person feels more anxious, insecure, and confused. If on the other hand you are a confident person and you use this confidence in life, you practice it and with time your confidence grows and you become better and succeed in life.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">So, every time when you \u201cget worried, scared or maybe experience small or large levels of fear from the unknown,\u201d examples could be a new job opportunity, promotion, new relationship, building boundaries or fighting your anxiety, you buy into it which means you let the fear get better of you, you stay where you are and with the time you move backward.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">Every exciting opportunity which comes your way requires a new positive way of thinking from YOU, something different so to speak, but when you start convincing yourself it is not for you, then as an effect, you will not do it. On this occasion, it means that self-sabotage became activated and you missed out.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">Self-sabotage is a coping mechanism and becomes apparent every time when you are about to make an important decision or change in your life (very often for the better) by convincing yourself that you should not do it, or it is actually bad for you.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">It is a process of thinking created at a subconscious level. You do it so quickly that sometimes you are not even aware of what and why you are doing it. It is fast and requires a lot of your positive energy and again it is on the subconscious level, and very often you are not even aware that you are doing it.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">There is no point fighting with it, creating complicated structures, or even think that you can progress in life without it. You can\u2019t! But luckily enough there are few things you can do right now in your life to help yourself:<\/p>\r\n\r\n<ol style=\"text-align: center;\">\r\n \t<li>Understand it and how it shows up in your life.<\/li>\r\n \t<li>Build a new coping mechanism \/ outsmart your own mind.<\/li>\r\n \t<li>Use your awareness to your benefit.<\/li>\r\n \t<li>Practice, practice, practice!!!<\/li>\r\n<\/ol>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>The more you do it, the better you become. <\/strong>The better you become, the better you feel about yourself, and the better your actions, the better the choices you will make for yourself, and with the time you improve your overall quality of life.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">There are only two ways how you can live your life, stay where you are, or become better. I help you to become better, so if this is what you want, get in touch on my website.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">When something repeats in your life and repeats more often than once, it is a sign that you need to take ownership and learn something new, which you have not learned before. \u00a0Until you do it, these things will keep showing up!!!<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">You can work on your self-sabotage with a coach like me or through the hard work to master this yourself.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>YOUR LIFE YOUR CALL!<\/strong><\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Firstly let me explain in full what self-sabotage is.
