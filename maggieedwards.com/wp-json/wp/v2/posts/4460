Sit down in a quiet place, take your laptop, iPad, or a personal calendar where you plan your week or day,\u00a0and do the following:\r\n\r\n<strong>Step 1.\u00a0Sort your activities into high-value tasks.\u00a0<\/strong>\r\n\r\nHigh-priority tasks are\u00a0absolutely essential to be done by you and bring\u00a0the highest value in the project, business, and\u00a0your life.\u00a0If you are an entrepreneur like me, you know that there is so much time in a day and millions of things to do, every day. You are not able to do everything by yourself\u00a0each day. You need to prioritize, delegate, and focus on the highest value activities every day, otherwise, your business will suffer.\r\nMark all these tasks and activities which will generate income, allow you to grow and scale.\u00a0In my case will be meaningful conversations with potential clients,\u00a0\u00a0consultations, supervising effectively my team, and planning and execution on my big projects like the \u201c Get a dream Job Masterclass\u201d planned\u00a0for May.\r\n\r\n<strong>Step 2.\u00a0Sort your activities into low-value tasks.\u00a0<\/strong>\r\n\r\nLow-value activities are nice to have but bring no value into the project you are doing, no value into the business, and no value into your life. Things with a low value for example are: triple-checking your mailbox, spending too much time on social media,\u00a0calling your friends during working hr, having multiple conversations about the same things\u00a0with your work colleagues, or doing visual updates on your website.\r\nThese things are nice to have, but as long as these can wait, should be minimized and pushed right at the end of the day, so you can do them later, or tomorrow and no one\u00a0will suffer.\r\nThis will allow you to focus more on &#8220;high-value activities&#8221; which in fact maximize your productivity and move things forward.\r\n\r\n<strong>Step 3.\u00a0Prioritize your\u00a0tasks in line with a level of urgency.\u00a0<\/strong>\r\n\r\nThe level of urgency can create the most results for you and transform your daily routines. Take a step back and think: What is the most important thing, the action step you should do right now? What&#8217;s the next best thing\u00a0you can do\u00a0at this moment\u00a0to move things forward? Who and why needs to be refocused and briefed? What next logical thing\u00a0will help to finish this report, master thesis, or allow you to get this interview?\r\nImportant things should\u00a0be always done first. You are in control of your\u00a0time and you decide every day what should be done and why. Do it with more care and intention and your productivity will go to the next level.\r\n<strong>Step 4.\u00a0Assign time to each activity.\u00a0<\/strong>\r\n\r\nTo some, it could be very easy to do, but to others, it could be very difficult. Use your common sense and past experience you have to know more or less how long will it take you to finish that chapter, report, or website. Don&#8217;t underestimate the time required to finish this task as best as you can. If you know that this task will take probably 1.5-2 hr then write that in and stick to it. Be honest with yourself, that helps a lot.\r\n\r\n<strong>Step 5.\u00a0Rearrange all tasks each day\u00a0starting with high-value and\u00a0highest-priority tasks!<\/strong>\r\n\r\nIf you start each day with high-value and high-priority tasks you are going to accelerate your progress, boost\u00a0productivity to a very high level.\r\nRemember this rule. During the day you make hundreds of decisions consciously and subconsciously, each decision you make moves you closer or moves you away from your goal or\u00a0dream.\r\n\r\n<em>You are in a driving seat every day.\u00a0<\/em>\r\nFor those of you who know me well, you know that I studied in Vienna (Austria) having multiple jobs, working at least 4 days a week being a student at the same time. I was studying for 5 years\u00a0and it was everything but easy, because I had to learn to maximize my time, mind, and my life. Back then I have\u00a0learned the best techniques\u00a0which accelerated my career in London and now help me to scale my business. You can do it too!\r\n\r\n<em>Anything is possible and it\u2019s all down to you and the choices you make every day.<\/em>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Not sure what to focus on?
