We do that by not starting at the right time, not starting at all or not finishing a task.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0<\/span>\r\n\r\nNotice an important point, we never procrastinate on things which matter to us the most! If something is really important\u00a0to us we will make it done. If something is a \u201chigh priority\u201d to us, we will get it done.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0<\/span>\r\n\r\nSo, if you are valuing in your life free time, relaxation, watching Netflix, you will spend a lot of time planning and executing your plans to make it happen. If you love to exercise, giving you pleasure and satisfaction, drive, challenge, then you will do \u201ceverything you can&#8221; during the day, week, month to make it happen. We only procrastinate on \u201clow propriety things\u201d and things which we understand what we get in return.\r\n\r\nThere are few things about procrastination you should know about:<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0<\/span>\r\n\r\n<strong>We procrastinate on \u201clow priority\u201d activities.\u00a0<\/strong>If you are working on a new project, maybe you got a promotion and you manage a group of people, if these things are \u201cnot your highest priority\u201d, even though in reality these things should be done, at the end of the day it won\u2019t be done well, or it won\u2019t be done at all, because \u201cyou simply think, believe that this is not high priority task\u201d.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0<\/span>\r\n\r\n<strong>We procrastinate when we don\u2019t have the answer, or we simply don\u2019t know yet how a task needs to be done. <\/strong>For example, you need to <em>sort out a problem at work<\/em>, and you have never done it before ( i.e no past experience), you have no help from the management, and you just need to find a solution because on your own. If there is no set deadline, it won\u2019t get done, because you don\u2019t have the right answer, or you don\u2019t know how to do it.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0<\/span>\r\n\r\n<strong>We procrastinate when we decide to do something against our values. <\/strong>For example, you have decided that a great idea will be running a marathon in 6 months time because some of the guys at work are doing it, it\u2019s cool, and you just want to join in. During the preparation stage, <em>you begin to find out few things about yourself that you did not know before<\/em>, like:<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 <\/span><em>I only exercise with my friend, I don\u2019t like exercise alone. I don\u2019t like the slow progress, I can\u2019t see the results. I am hungry all the time, I don\u2019t know anything about healthy eating<\/em>. During this process, you\u00a0may say: \u201c I don\u2019t think this is for me, and the more you think about it, this conclusion follows: I value more my free time, rather than going for a run and train hard for this marathon which does not mean anything to me\u201d. Your value is actually\u201d<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 <\/span>having enough free time and rest\u201d not \u201c running and training at the gym\u201d. So your value wins.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0<\/span>\r\n\r\n<strong>We may procrastinate when we don\u2019t know the prize, i.e: \u201cwhat really are we getting in return\u201d<\/strong> once we put our effort, energy, focus into this task.\u00a0If we do something for the first time, it may be difficult to calculate and understand the full benefits of doing this thing. Most of us are risk-averse, which means if it&#8217;s something \u201cunfamiliar\u201d we don\u2019t want to do it. If you don\u2019t know your &#8220;why&#8221;, it won\u2019t get it done.\r\n\r\nOur minds will find the easiest, quickest way to full ourselves. We are so clever that we out clever ourselves and as a result, we get confused in our lives. You need to reverse engineer if you want to see the desired results. Simplify you&#8217;re thinking and you will simplify your life. Do what gives your pleasure, satisfaction in life, and live your life in line with <strong>&#8220;your own values&#8221;<\/strong>.\r\n\r\nIf you prioritise one activity over another, you know why you are doing it, you have a positive attitude towards this activity, \u00a0you will get it done- ALWAYS.","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>We often procrastinate because that thing we need to do is not important right now, or we are afraid of failing at the task that we need to complete.
