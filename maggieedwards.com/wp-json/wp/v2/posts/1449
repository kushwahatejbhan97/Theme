Is it the same as the gut feeling? Do you know how to use it? Can you distinguish between intuition and fear?\r\n\r\nThis is one of the subjects which I constantly get diverse opinions. Based on my experience I strongly believe that everyone has intuition and we all have experienced it at some point in our lives. If we decided to ignore it, and never checked with the end result, that&#8217;s a different story. We all can learn how to use it to our advantage, but we need to be willing to practice, stay patient, focused and be happy about your life, \u00a0in order to fully access this secret guiding voice.\r\n\r\nBy definition, intuition has the ability to understand the situation instinctively, via your subconscious mind and without the need for conscious reasoning. It is the tiny voice inside of us, which is there to protect us, telling us that maybe something is wrong, maybe that \u201cthing\u201d is not good for us or that we should just stay away from it for some reason. Or to tell us in advance, that this thing which we want to do or accomplish is good for us, it will work out whilst having fun.\u00a0It is tricky in the sense that it is difficult to rationalise, but if you stay focused, then you will be able to really understand, and then use it to your advantage.\u00a0Once you know how to use intuition, it can tremendously powerful in your business or relationship decisions or exploring new things in life, and based on those benefits it is worth the attention.\r\n\r\nMy clients who join my coaching programs and decide to follow their intuition are feeling good about themselves, they are feeling safe and authentic and I believe this is extremely beneficial. My second suggestion is to tune yourself into this tiny voice, don&#8217;t force it, just tune into it, once you feel it because it will guide you to where you need to go. Not sure? Just try it for yourself.\u00a0Use this quick and simple exercise and see what happens:\r\n\r\nFind a comfortable and quiet place. Ideally, it should not be in front of your laptop or TV, away from barking dogs or screaming kids. Close your eyes and take three deep breaths (if you meditate, use meditation techniques). Calm your mind and tune yourself into your breathing and body. Ground yourself for three minutes, and once you are there, ask yourself a question to which you don\u2019t have the answer. Don\u2019t over complicate it and\u00a0keep it simple. Once you have done this, sit in the same position for another three minutes and with your closed eyes, without any distractions. Your answer will emerge.\r\n\r\nIf you follow the instructions carefully you will receive your true answer. If not, either the question was too complex and you need to simplify it, or you have skipped a few steps because you became distracted.\u00a0The more you practice the better you become. I encourage you to practice because Practice creates mastery! Join my coaching program and you will master it.\r\n<blockquote>\u201cListen to your intuition.\u00a0It will tell you everything you need to know\u201d\r\n\r\nAnthony J.D\u2019Angelo<\/blockquote>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Are you in tune with your intuition?
