Do you speak your mind? Are you easily influenced by other opinions? Do you value yourself and what you stand for? These questions alone will allow you to understand where you are at with your confidence levels and help you understand if there is something to work on.\r\n\r\nSelf-confidence is important, because it shows through many aspects in our life, it shows up at work, how we manage our career, in our relationships, it just plays a huge role. Sometimes it comes unseen, and not many actually will pay attention. But, it drives our behaviour, influences our thinking, decisions and helps to set up our boundaries. It is the underlying foundation of our lifestyle, accomplishments and representation of our character.\r\n\r\nSometimes we may not realise how much it affects us, and to make things worse, we confuse the matter by covering it up by attaching certain common identities to ourselves like: I am just this way, I am shy, introvert, I am risk averse, I am just sensitive.\r\n\r\nWhat happens later? As we progress in our lives we believe that this is who we are, this is our identity, and we simply stay like this. Our natural instinct is telling us to stick with something \u2019familiar and safe\u2019, rather than question our own labels, maybe even our believes, to see if maybe we need to update some, and check if this is still working for us.\u00a0It is risky and brave to expose ourselves in front of a big audience, family or friends showing our creativity, going outside our comfort zone (whatever it is for you), therefore naturally we prefer to hold back, feel safe and secure.\r\n\r\nBy sticking to this behavioural pattern what do we gain? What do we loose?\r\n\r\nWe grow, develop and change with time. The same applies to our confidence. Very often if we are forced to make a brave move, create new change in our life, and do things outside our comfort zone, it gives us eventually a sense of achievement and pride. It provides us with a deeper insight of who are and how we operate, learn and grow.\r\n\r\nConfidence is something that we can improve anytime and anywhere. By doing something new, different, brave and creative, leads to new experiences, feelings and challenges which might be totally unexpected and fun. But you won\u2019t know, until you have tried it. For you to try it, you need to equip yourself with enough confidence and bravery to do it! You give yourself then a chance to learn about yourself, boost your confidence levels and gain an insight about yourself.\u00a0True confidence comes from you, it shines through you, and it represents you.\u00a0Self-confidence creates momentum, progress and it\u2019s deeply connected to your success and failure.\r\n\r\nIf you decide to work on your confidence sooner or later you will make the next step. You will say out loud what you think, what you stand for, create new boundaries, follow your dreams and desires and all that leads to your happiness and beautiful exploration. Life!\r\n<blockquote>Confidence comes not from always being right, but from not fearing to be wrong (Peter McIntyre)<\/blockquote>\r\nNew experiences and growth improves your confidence. Once you boost it, you will become happier.\r\n\r\nIf you want to share your story get in touch, I would love to hear from you.","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Do you think you have enough self-confidence to make the next difficult step in your life?
