My clients are 99% women &#8211; beautiful, talented, skilled, \u00a0intelligent, ambitious and most of them are hiding away, playing small in their carrier, business and relationships, not speaking up their truth and by doing so making themselves miserable, unhappy, unfulfilled, used and confused. We all have different talents and gifts which are here to be used!\r\n\r\nSo I ask:\r\n<ol>\r\n \t<li>Does it work for you?<\/li>\r\n \t<li>Does it serve you?<\/li>\r\n \t<li>What is the cost of you staying like it?<\/li>\r\n \t<li>How long are you planning to carry on like it?<\/li>\r\n<\/ol>\r\nFrom this point, there are not that many choices, to be frank, there are only two! You either break free from old patterns, bad behaviours and take charge of your life, forgive yourself and stand tall, confident and commit to your personal transformation walking towards things you want and need in life OR you give up all these beautiful plans and ambition to stay where you are. My mentor is saying:\r\n\r\n<strong>&#8221; Maggie you never stay the same, you either\u00a0get better or worse&#8221;<\/strong> \u00a0and I found this to be true.\r\n\r\nIf any of this resonates with you \u00a0&#8220;Don&#8217;t worry, YOU simply did not get the memo, but don&#8217;t worry, it is fixable!&#8221;\r\n\r\nThere are many reasons why you sell yourself short, and as the research confirms these may include past experiences, drama, emotional pain, lack of acceptance, lack of love or direction. However, I am ONLY interested in YOUR transformation. I won&#8217;t spend countless hours talking about it, we will identify the problem and ONLY focus on the solutions. I will teach you methods and strategies which you can apply from day one, which are easy to understand and follow. Our mind is exceptionally powerful and we will use the power of your mind to create new habits, strategies so that you can achieve everything you want in LIFE. \u00a0It is not a matter of luck, it is neuroscience.\r\n\r\nThat&#8217;s why I love working with women because we are so resourceful and skilled, yet we put ourselves down and don&#8217;t give ourselves enough credit for our work.\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>&#8220;The most important words are the words you say to yourself&#8221;\u00a0<\/strong><\/p>\r\nIt is the absolute truth, because if you use on a daily basis negative, critical or judgemental language, then this is how you will feel, think and perform. With this type of behaviour, you will never move out of your comfort zone, as the EGO and feeling safe and familiar will ALWAYS keep you where you are. It is a combination of your conscious and subconscious programming, which is the driving force behind your life and looking closely at the results, they tell you that this is TRUE!\r\n\r\nIf this resonates with you, I can&#8217;t wait to connect with you. Life is too beautiful to play it safe and small. \u00a0I can&#8217;t wait to see you ONCE AGAIN being confident, happy and successful! That is my job.\u00a0There are many beautiful things waiting for you&#8230;\r\n\r\nGet in touch today if you want to join a tribe of powerful women.\r\n\r\nxo,\u00a0Maggie","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>&#8221; Seriously ? &#8221; she says. &#8221; Yes, it is not Your fault, You simply did not get the memo &#8221; I reply.
