Are you searching or have you found it yet?<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">We all have different purposes in life and that\u2019s great as we are all different. We search for and accomplish different things. Some of us are amazing mothers, careers, teachers, businesswomen, supporters &#8230;. and that&#8217;s brilliant! As long as you love what you do, I am sure you would not change it for the world and that&#8217;s all that matters.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">It does not matter &#8221;what&#8221; that is, what matters to you is that you understand it, you identify yourself with it, and you own it. It is your life and it is our job to go and find our true purpose &#8211; whatever that may be.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">When I was 17 years old, I read \u00a0The Alchemist by Paulo Coelho and I became obsessed with &#8220;finding my purpose.&#8221; I have always questioned many times in my life what my true purpose was. At times I knew that things were wrong and not good for me, but others I would go with the flow, and when I was ready to make up my mind, I ran with the decision I had made.<\/p>\r\n<p class=\"gmail_quote\" style=\"text-align: center;\">Of course, I was not aware to the same degree as I am now, that I was searching for my purpose in life and that&#8217;s is why I made a lot of mistakes along the way. For example, I knew that finance was not really my thing, but since I am not a quitter I was 100% committed. Throughout my finance journey I was excited and visionary at times, but really committed for the whole 15 years, until 2017. Also, I could have stayed a shorter time in Vienna if I wanted, finishing my bachelor degree and moving to London earlier than what I did. However at that point in time, nothing was set up, and I was just not ready for it. I also could have quit ACCA, because there were many moments I was bored and I felt uninspired, however, I couldn&#8217;t do it. I would have seen it as a failure, and I just could not allow that to happen.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<\/div>\r\n<p class=\"gmail_quote\" style=\"text-align: center;\">Those experiences definitely shaped my life, my character, and I could only be grateful for it.\r\nWhen my Coach helped me to connect with my true self back in 2017, I became more aware of my actions, decisions and started noticing all opportunities and that this was my rebirth of finding my true purpose in life. In fact, it was like a quest!<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">If you have read some of the literature of amazing writers like Napoleon Hill or\u00a0Paulo Coelho\u00a0they promote similar messages. They educate us on the importance of doing things we are really good at, growing, evolving and contributing to the society, as well as being honest to who we are and following our destiny.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<\/div>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">They also educate us in universal laws which are unbeatable. The fact that some of these books were written more than 100 years ago, and are still relevant, makes you wonder why they don&#8217;t teach these aspects at school today and why these strong messages of promoting strong positivity more often have to be questioned. But why is this?<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">Well, because we only find true happiness in life when we follow our heart and intuition, and not our parents, teachers and what others expect us we should do. this will ONLY happen WHEN we stop battling with our minds and hearts and accept ourselves for who we truly are, WHEN we stop being scared of tomorrow because we know that everything will be Ok, WHEN we look closely at our behaviour and stop pretending that it is not a world issue, it is actually the US. We need to truly start being honest with ourselves NOW!!!<\/p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: center;\">My point is that we all have a certain role to play on this planet and we should search for it until we find it! We should never give up. We are made for an abundance of success, happiness and prosperity and we are the most intelligent creation there is! We have powerful brains, which help us achieve greatness. You can achieve it once you know how to. The good news is that now we know-how. We all have hidden talents and gifts which we should use and share with the world. We are the one and only species who are capable of creating mastery.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">\u00a0We are not made to be single and sad. We are not here to live and struggle in pain and misery. If you don&#8217;t believe me, read some of the books I mentioned above and then you will understand! you will not be disappointed.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<div dir=\"ltr\">\r\n<p class=\"gmail_quote\" style=\"text-align: center;\">We only need to tap into this resourceful brain which we all have, and allow the brilliance to shine through!\u00a0You first accept the challenge, you see the opportunities and then create. Just remember that they are always in the same order! Your purpose is like your hidden treasure. You will need to go on this journey, experience what the journey brings and eventually you will find your purpose in life!!Trust me it is well worth it!<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">When you find your purpose in life you will find everything that you need to live.<\/p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: center;\">You will know and feel when you are there!<\/p>\r\n\r\n<\/div>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Your purpose is the real deal!
