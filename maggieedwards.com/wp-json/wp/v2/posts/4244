And instead of you &#8220;pursuing your thing&#8221;, ignoring their point of view you, you have\u00a0lost so much time, energy, got discouraged or even (in a worst-case scenario) abandoned your dream\u00a0because you kept\u00a0explaining your point\u00a0and subsequently with the time you lost\u00a0the drive to accomplish your goal? I call it simply: Got exhausted or\u00a0drained.\u00a0Have you ever experienced that?\r\n\r\nWell, I been in such a situation million times and even though I am confident, and most of the time I know my worth such conversations always to some degree\u00a0knocked me down. Until this day, I am having such situations with different people, in various places,\u00a0but now I am approaching it differently.\r\n\r\nI finally grasped the idea that we don&#8217;t always need to agree and that I am in charge of my dreams, so it is up to me how I manage them.\r\n\r\nTo manage such situations better you could try:\r\n\r\n<strong>1. Save your energy\u00a0for important things!\u00a0<\/strong>\r\nFor example, important business meetings, emergency calls with clients or family time.\r\nThere is no point in trying to explain something to someone who does not get it.\r\nThe sooner you realise it, the more time you save.\u00a0<u>Your energy is precious<\/u>, your &#8220;headspace&#8221; belongs to you, and it\u00a0is, in fact, worth &#8220;millions&#8221;, if only you learn how to manage it. \u00a0If you allow someone\u00a0negative opinion or a viewpoint to be stored in your mind, it means that you did not yet\u00a0learnt how to manage your own headspace.\r\n\r\n<strong>2. Change the subject immediately!<\/strong>\r\nI accept their point of view and move on. FAST.\u00a0The faster I do it, the better results I get. We all go through life in different stages, speed and intensity. There are moments when you are on fire, feeling unstoppable\u00a0and moments of nostalgia or emotional pain. We need to manage each stage\u00a0in the right way. We can&#8217;t ignore it well at least we should not, but we should do what can with what we have to the best of our abilities. So, we\u00a0take time off,\u00a0hire a coach, go to therapy, and things like that take time. So, if my friend is totally different stage in her life, it is simply complicated for her to understand.\r\n\r\n<strong>3. Minimise the contact.<\/strong>\r\nIf I see that someone does not have a clue about what I am saying, I say to myself &#8220;<strong>Minimise the contact&#8221;.<\/strong>\u00a0And I don&#8217;t want to be rude or disrespectful.\u00a0What that does it to <strong>create a clear mental boundary<\/strong> between me + dream and that person. If I know that this person does not get it, on a bad day, I definitely won&#8217;t call this person and ask for help. That would be insane, as this person will say something which will hurt you even\u00a0more. Don&#8217;t believe me, try it.\r\n\r\n<strong>4. Set priorities<\/strong>\r\nA reality check. I always ask a question: &#8220;Who&#8217;s job is to make MY DREAM a reality?&#8221;Since it is my dream, it is my responsibility to protect it and pursuit it.\r\n\r\nAre you protecting your dreams? Are you moving towards or away from your dream?","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Are you misunderstood by your environment?
