But the coach is not going to tell you what you should or should not do, this in the industry is called\u00a0&#8220;mentoring&#8221; which is\u00a0applicable in a business environment for example providing a\u00a0business coaching services. A life coach\u00a0is facilitating a\u00a0<strong><u>deeper level of self-discovery<\/u>,<\/strong> which\u00a0leads\u00a0to the better-thinking process, noticing and grabbing opportunities, taking better decisions, taking action\u00a0and as a result achieving the desired outcome.\u2611\ufe0f\r\n\r\n<strong><u>2. Coaching is just like therapy<\/u><\/strong><strong>\u00a0\u00a0<\/strong>\r\nNo, it is not, because coaching is future-oriented and the therapy is past-oriented.\u00a0Coaching focuses on the present situation making your future better!\u00a0\ud83e\udd29\u00a0This is the most important goal and coaching objective. During the therapy, counselling, with a psychologist\u00a0the client is discussing &#8220;the past&#8221; drama, emotions, trying to understand why today they are this way. This also on its\u00a0own has many limitations, and I will discuss it in the following post. Coaching builds a better future, and since it is\u00a0focusing\u00a0on success, as long as the client wants success, he\/ she will get there. It only depends on the client desire to make the future better, everything else flows nicely, and results appear.\u00a0\u2611\ufe0f\r\n\r\n<strong><u>3. Coaching does not work<\/u><\/strong><strong>\u00a0<\/strong>\r\nHave you tried hiring a coach? What is your experience?\u00a0\u00a0Choosing a coach is like choosing a dentist; you want a <strong>Good ONE!!! <\/strong>If not the best one on\u00a0the market.\u00a0Your teeth\u00a0are important. If a dentist makes a big\u00a0mistake, you might end up with no teeth\u00a0which then can have big consequences financially and practically. Since you don&#8217;t want a rubbish dentist, you also don&#8217;t want a common coach. This rule really works, it goes like this:<em>&#8221;\u00a0the better the coach, the better your results&#8221;.<\/em> \u00a0When hiring a coach, you are investing in yourself and your future. Coaching is designed to bring results, and both the client and the coach must know it. It is easier to choose a coach with whom you are feeling good about yourself. You\u00a0like this person and are excited to work together.\u00a0It is a process of\u00a0building a professional relationship, where you work on the goal together. Coach has knowledge and experience\u00a0to speed up the change\u00a0process using modern\u00a0techniques\u00a0if the client is up for it. <strong>It does not work because you have not tried it yet.\u00a0<\/strong>\u2611\ufe0f\r\n\r\nI hope you find it useful.
